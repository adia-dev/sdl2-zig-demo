# SDL2 Zig Demo

## Demo

Check out the demo of the SDL2 Zig Demo in action:

The demo showcases a simple application window created using SDL2 in Zig. The window allows user interaction and displays a red square that can be moved using arrow keys. Additionally, it renders text on the window to display information such as the position and speed of the square.

## How to Build and Run

To build and run the SDL2 Zig Demo, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/adia-dev/sdl2-zig-demo.git
```


2. Change into the project directory:

```bash
cd sdl2-zig-demo
```

3. Build the project:

```bash
zig build run
```

This will compile the code and execute the resulting binary, launching the SDL2 Zig Demo window.

## Prerequisites

Before running the SDL2 Zig Demo, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:
